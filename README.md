# Design and UVM Verification of an ALU

This repository contains the design and UVM (Universal Verification Methodology) verification code for an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU). The ALU is a fundamental component in digital systems that performs arithmetic and logical operations.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the design and verification of an ALU using UVM, a widely adopted methodology for verifying complex digital designs. By implementing the ALU design and verification code in this repository, you can gain a deeper understanding of digital logic design and verification techniques.

## Features
1- ALU Design:  The repository provides the RTL (Register Transfer Level) design of the ALU. The design includes various arithmetic and logical operations such as addition, subtraction, AND, XOR, etc. The design is implemented in a System Verilog hardware description language (HDL).

2- UVM Verification:  The repository includes a UVM verification environment that thoroughly tests the functionality and correctness of the ALU design. 

3- Documentation:  Detailed documentation is provided to guide you through the design and verification process. The documentation explains the ALU architecture, the UVM methodology, and how to run the verification environment. It also provides insights into best practices for design and verification.
